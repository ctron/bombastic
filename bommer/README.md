# bommer â€“ BOMs pods

*WIP* This is in an experimental state.

## Running

You will need an instance of [bombastic](https://github.com/xkcd-2347) running. If it's not running on `localhost:8080`,
you also need to set the URL using the environment variable `BOMBASTIC_URL`.

```shell
env BIND_ADDR="[::]:8010" cargo run
```
